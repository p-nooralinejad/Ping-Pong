Hi,
This project is done by [me](https://github.com/p-nooralinejad), [kianoosh abbasi](https://github.com/Kianoosh76)and [arya kowsary](https://github.com/somagh) during our high school. It's a 3D ping pong game with Reinforcement learning agent that evolves as you play with it. Implemented in C++ using OpenGL, we tried to make it as natural as possible.
